# GitHub Pages Deployment Instructions
## Quest Waste Solutions Website Clone

🎉 **Your website is ready for deployment!** This guide will walk you through deploying your Quest Waste Solutions website clone to GitHub Pages.

## 📦 Deployment Package

**File**: `questwaste-github-pages-deployment.zip`

This package contains:
- ✅ Complete static site export (`/out` directory)
- ✅ All 13 pages with GitHub Pages paths configured
- ✅ All assets (images, CSS, JavaScript) properly optimized
- ✅ `.nojekyll` file for GitHub Pages compatibility
- ✅ EmailJS setup guide (`EMAIL_SETUP.md`)

## 🚀 Deployment Options

### Option 1: GitHub Repository Deployment (Recommended)

1. **Create a new GitHub repository**:
   - Go to [github.com](https://github.com) and create a new repository
   - Name it `questwasteWebsite` (or any name you prefer)
   - Make it public
   - Don't initialize with README, .gitignore, or license

2. **Extract and upload the files**:
   - Extract `questwaste-github-pages-deployment.zip`
   - Upload the contents of the `out/` folder to your repository
   - The repository root should contain: `index.html`, `assets/`, `_next/`, `.nojekyll`, etc.

3. **Enable GitHub Pages**:
   - Go to your repository Settings
   - Scroll down to "Pages" section
   - Source: "Deploy from a branch"
   - Branch: `main` (or `master`)
   - Folder: `/ (root)`
   - Click "Save"

4. **Your site will be available at**:
   ```
   https://yourusername.github.io/questwasteWebsite/
   ```

### Option 2: GitHub Pages from Zip

If you prefer a simpler approach:

1. **Create a new repository named exactly**: `yourusername.github.io`
   - Replace `yourusername` with your actual GitHub username
   - This creates a user/organization site

2. **Update the configuration** (if using this option):
   - You'll need to rebuild with `basePath: ''` instead of `/questwasteWebsite`
   - Contact me if you need help with this adjustment

3. **Your site will be available at**:
   ```
   https://yourusername.github.io/
   ```

## ⚙️ Configuration Details

The site is pre-configured for GitHub Pages with:

- **Base Path**: `/questwasteWebsite` (for repository deployment)
- **Asset Prefix**: `/questwasteWebsite/` (ensures all assets load correctly)
- **Static Export**: All pages are pre-rendered as HTML
- **No Jekyll**: `.nojekyll` file prevents Jekyll processing
- **Trailing Slash**: Ensures proper routing on static hosting

## 📧 Email Configuration

Your contact form is ready to work with EmailJS. After deployment:

1. **Follow the EmailJS setup guide** in `EMAIL_SETUP.md`
2. **Get your EmailJS credentials**:
   - Service ID
   - Template ID
   - Public Key
3. **Update the contact form** with your actual EmailJS credentials
4. **Test the form** to ensure emails are being sent to support@questwaste.net

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Site not loading properly?
- Check that the repository name matches the `basePath` configuration
- Ensure `.nojekyll` file is present in the root
- Wait a few minutes for GitHub Pages to deploy (can take up to 10 minutes)

### Assets not loading?
- Verify the `basePath` matches your repository name
- Check that all files from the `out/` directory were uploaded correctly

### Form not sending emails?
- Complete the EmailJS setup as described in `EMAIL_SETUP.md`
- Update the contact form with your actual EmailJS credentials
